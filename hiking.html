        <p style="font-size: small;">Once we had passed massive cracks, holes and glacial waterfalls, we came to the ice wall that we were going to climb. And that’s when the fear set in.

            I didn’t want anyone to know how scared I truly was, so I offered to be one of the first to go. I was given ice climbing axes and harnessed to a line that was anchored at the top of the wall. One of the guides would be holding the other end of the line and adjusting the slack so I wouldn’t fall.</p>
            <p style="font-size: small;">There was no real danger and, even if I fell off the wall, I was tightly harnessed and would have merely hung like a Christmas ornament. Going up wasn’t the scary part. It’s always the down part I have a hard time wrapping my head around.

                I kicked my crampons into the ice wall and slammed my ice axes in until they felt strong enough to hold, and then I began my ascent to the top. It was surprisingly easy to maneuver the ice wall and I made it to the top without falling.</p>
