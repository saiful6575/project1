        <p class="para-3">One of our most recently launched trips, onboard the MS Quest, where you'll go whale watching, cruise through Arctic Fjords, and hunting for the Northern Lights. Alex, a member of our Northern Lights Travel Expert team, has just got back from embarking on the maiden voyage and wrote this fantastic review.</p>

<p style="font-size: small;">In talking to locals, including our new friend The Aurora Hunter, no one in Iceland had seen the Northern Lights in 3 weeks prior to our sighting. Storms had moved in clouding up the night skies and there just wasn’t much activity going on on the sun.

    Had we visited Iceland, Finland, Norway or Svalbard only hoping to see the Northern Lights, we’d probably have been really disappointed. Instead, each destination gave us fantastic opportunities to be mushers for the day, </p>
    <p style="font-size: small;">In order to see the Northern Lights, you need a dark, clear night. They are visible from late August to early April anytime during dark hours, which in places like Abisko or Tromsø can be nearly 24 hours a day in winter. There also needs to be solar flares on the sun or solar wind; the Aurora Borealis happens when particles from the sun enter Earth’s atmosphere and collide violently with gas atoms. </p>
    <p style="font-size: small;">The Northern Lights are actually active all year round. But because they are only typically visible in the aurora zone between 65° and 72° North, they are not visible from April through August when the aurora zone experiences nearly 24 hours of daylight. People just tend to associate Northern Lights with the cold since they are visible in the winter months, but we have seen them in August in very comfortable temperatures.</p>
