            <p style="margin-left: 30px;"> Since it does need to be dark in order to see the Northern Lights in the sky,
                late August/September through the very beginning of April is the best time to go to a destination
                located in the aurora zone for a chance to see them.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">It’s a destination unlike any other in Europe. Its unique landscapes and
                natural wonders perfectly complement the modern capital of Reykjavik with its café culture and boozy,
                rambunctious nightlife.Iceland is known as both the Land of Elves and the Land of Fire and Ice. It’s a
                country where you’ll find smoldering active volcanoes and vivid blue glaciers side by side. Horses and
                sheep dot the countryside, colorful puffins flock along the cliffs, and whales breach the choppy
                Atlantic waters that envelop this tiny island</p>
